# WaterDispencer

This water bottle filler uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect when a water bottle is in place. The water flow then opens until the water level sensor closes it again. Theres a water flow meter that logs the volume of water and an lcd that displays the volume in liters.Finally when done the solenoid closes and the buzzer buzzes.

Feel free to use or modify my project
